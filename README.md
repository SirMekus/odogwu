# Installation

This is a test project to get you started in exploring the power of two of my open-source packages - [Ahia](https://github.com/SirMekus/ahia) and [Zam](https://github.com/SirMekus/zam). Also, you can build a fresh 'native' PHP application off this project; just download and build on it (bundling and directory structure has already been created but you can edit it to your taste. Refer to the packages' documentation for more infomation).

1. Run `composer install`
1. Run `npm install`
1. Create your `.env` file from the `.env.example` file downloaded
1. Run the dump.sql file (or import it to your database)
1. Enjoy your surfing
