# Installation

This is a test project to get you started in exploring the power of two of my open-source packages - [Ahia](https://github.com/SirMekus/ahia) (OOP-way database CRUD operation), [Igwe](https://github.com/SirMekus/igwe) (file upload) and [Zam](https://github.com/SirMekus/zam) (front-end development including AJAX call). 

Also, you can build a fresh 'native' PHP application off this project; just download and build on it (bundling and directory structure has already been created but you can edit it to your taste. Refer to the packages' documentations for more infomation).

1. Run `composer install`
1. Run `npm install`
1. Create your `.env` file from the `.env.example` file downloaded
1. Run the `dump.sql` file (or import it to your database. For simplicity please create a database named `reg`. However, you can choose to use whatever name you prefer, just don't forget to change it in the .env file).
1. Enjoy your surfing
